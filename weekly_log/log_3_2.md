## Research Log


Spring, Week 6
----------------
  
### This Week's Work

Split data in 70% training and 30% testing data and stratified on tree classes and updated trained models results. The results with the new training data were slightly worse, since there was less observations. Created table with number of polygons per raster strip per species. Added random forest ntry tuning and hyperparameters model comparisons and finished working on thesis revisions.

### Upcoming Work

Finish code to predict pixel tree species. Run models over raster images, map results, and add to results chapter.

### Points of confusion

Not sure if the pixels count should be included in the table of polygons per raster strip. Tried to create a side-by-side kable table of model accuracy with different hyperparameters, but it was stacked instead of side-by-side.
