## Research Log


Fall, Week 4
----------------
  
### This Week's Work
- Summarized three texts related to my project
- Downloaded data from planet.com
- Made training set of oak, maple, redcedar, and other trees that contains large enough trees (crown width >= 20ft) and is spread apart

### Upcoming Work
- Draw polygons around the crown of selected training trees
- Geographic join polygons with training set to create a tidy table

### Points of confusion
Not sure how to open a JSON file downloaded from Planet.com in RStudio and draw polygons around trees.
