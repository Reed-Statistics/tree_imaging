## Research Log


Spring, Week 3
----------------
  
### This Week's Work and Work over Break
- edited data chapter and some limitations to the data
- added some methods
- create masks for raster images:
  + masking ndvi values below 0.0
  + masking average of bands to remove grass pixels: (ir + red + blue + green)/4 values above 5100

### Upcoming Work
- Methods chapter
- Expand on other chapters
  + add more exploratory analysis for ground data and pixels data
  + add images showing the process of drawing polygons

### Points of confusion
The idea for distinguishing between grass pixels and tree pixels using the average of the bands comes from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866719305254, however, the article talks about a Canny edge detection algorithm (https://www.isip.piconepress.com/courses/msstate/ece_4773/projects/1997/group_image/paper/paper1.pdf). Not sure if it's better to possibly cut off some maple and western redcedar pixels to avoid having any grass pixels or if it's better to risk modelling grass pixels as trees. Not sure if a threshold of 5100 for the average of the bands is the best threshold for the grass mask.

Also, I couldn't find the 8 band images from Planet.com, but Landsat 8 images have 11 bands but the pixels are 30m (https://developers.planet.com/docs/data/landsat-8/). I've looked for 4 band images in earlier years, and they only offer Landsat 8 in 2015-2018. 4 band images start appearing in 2019.
