## Research Log


Fall, Week 2
----------------

### This Week's Work
Went over general ideas of hyperspectral imaging and convolusional neural networks.

### Upcoming Work
- Try downloading data from planet.com
- Download QGIS and learn how to use it
- Read article about CNN
- Move Github Repo
- Summarize three texts relevant to the project

### Points of confusion
Had trouble understanding what the steps are in a convolutional neural network.
