## Research Log


Fall, Week 5
----------------
  
### This Week's Work
- Created polygons for 5 species of trees
- Downloaded data from planet.com
- Made training set of oak, maple, redcedar, and other trees that contains large enough trees (crown width >= 20ft) and is spread apart

### Upcoming Work
- Geographic join polygons with training set to create tidy tables:
1. Table of polygons and tree information
2. Table of pixels with light, polygon, and tree information
- Work on data chapter draft

### Points of confusion
Need to figure out whether to complete the geographic join in R or QGIS
