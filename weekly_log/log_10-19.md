## Research Log


Fall, Week 6
----------------
  
### This Week's Work
- Joined polygons to points data in R
- Extracted values from single raster image in R

### Upcoming Work
- Figure out why there are too many pixels for single image

### Points of confusion
Have too many pixel counts for each species in single image, should end up with less than 10000 observations.
