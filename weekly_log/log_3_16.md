## Research Log


Spring, Week 8
----------------
  
### This Week's Work

Created code to model results over Portland, compared RF to SVM models, and compared to pdxTrees. Fixed Table 2.4 code. Created simple convolutional neural network model.

### Upcoming Work

Use Fricker parameters for cnn model, add to results and start discussion chapter.

### Points of confusion

In Fricker paper, they train the cnn model on the raster image with polygons as independent observations. Do random forest and svm models assume independence of observations?
