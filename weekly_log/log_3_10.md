## Research Log


Spring, Week 7
----------------
  
### This Week's Work

Filtered masked images to only include pixels within the Portland city boundary. Ran top svm and rf models over entire Portland region using multithreading. One raster strip takes around 1 hour to be modelled. Organized thesis sections.

### Upcoming Work

Map results over Portland regions, and add to results chapter.

### Points of confusion

Wanted to check whether Tree Imaging should be the thesis topic/title. Also, was struggling with finding a fast method of comparing the results to the Western Redcedars locations from street maps. Most likely will have to use base plot for the map.
