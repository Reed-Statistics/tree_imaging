Spring, Week 11
----------------
  
### This Week's Work

Compared SVM with standardized variables to SVM with normalized variables and found that standardized produces better results overall. Pushed rough draft of results and discussion chapter to github. Removed grass pixels from training data. Updated training data to select even number of pixels from each tree species. Started revisions.

Reran results with grass pixels included but only masked NDVI values for rasters in final model. Updated thesis chapters with revisions. Started reorganizing code for appendix.

### Upcoming Work

Format and organize code for appendix. Revise previous chapters and add abstract! Start working on presentation.

### Points of confusion

The best model for predicting Western redcedars was the random forest not on the grouped data. The results might improve if I go back to using a training dataset with an uneven number of pixels from each category, but I'm not sure which is better in trying to build a model for use with other rasters in the future.
