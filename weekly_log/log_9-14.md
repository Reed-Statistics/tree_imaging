## Research Log


Fall, Week 1
----------------

### This Week's Work
Got thesis proposal approved and met with thesis advisor. Went over syllabus and expectations. Started going over research question and some introductory information about spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging. Also discussed how the desired data will be acquired.

### Upcoming Work
Read the article of interest listed in the Thesis Proposals Google Docs (https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/north/psw_2019_north009_fricker.pdf) and research other articles mentioned in that one along with articles that cite this one.

### Points of confusion
Had trouble understanding what the steps are in a convolutional neural network.
