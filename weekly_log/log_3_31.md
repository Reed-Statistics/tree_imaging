Spring, Week 10
----------------
  
### This Week's Work

Compared SVM with standardized variables to SVM with normalized variables and found that standardized produces better results overall. Pushed rough draft of results and discussion chapter to github. Removed grass pixels from training data. Updated training data to select even number of pixels from each tree species. Started revisions.

### Upcoming Work

Update results and results chapter. Format and organize code for appendix. Revise results, discussion chapter and add overview and abstract!

### Points of confusion

The ranger method is much faster than the rf method, but I can't produce the nice looking mtry graphs.
