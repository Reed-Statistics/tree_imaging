## Research Log


Spring, Week 9
----------------
  
### This Week's Work

Created code to model results over Portland, compared RF to SVM models, and compared to pdxTrees. Fixed Table 2.4 code. Created simple convolutional neural network model.
Created groups of maple and oak tree species and ran results. Included grouped training data models hyperparameters, polygon results, and test results. Made revisions to methods chapter. Worked on CNN models.

### Upcoming Work

Add CNN model to methods chapter. Finish results and discussion chapter and revise thesis!

### Points of confusion

In Fricker paper, it looks like they extract the pixels into a dataframe... I wasn't sure about this before, but I don't need to remake rasters for a CNN training set. I was also wondering what to include in the results chapter besides training and final model images. Should descriptive results include masking results?
