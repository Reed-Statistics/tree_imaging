## Research Log


Spring, Week 5
----------------
  
### This Week's Work

Thesis:
Added tuning parameters and model comparisons to methods section and added theory sections for support vector machines and random forest models. Started working on thesis revisions.

Models:
Added predictor variables and figured out tuning parameters.

### Upcoming Work

Finish thesis revisions, convert train/test ratio to 70%/30%. Finish code to predict pixel tree species. Run models over raster images and map results.

### Points of confusion

Want to confirm that the train data should be set aside before training the models so the cross-validation is only on train data and the reported accuracy comes from the cross validation analysis and also the accuracy of the model on the test data.

From the imaging chapter, I couldn't find the image dimensions in terms of axis parallel to flight path and perpendicular to flight path. I was trying to figure out if it had anything to do with the view angle or the bit-depth or the grid overlap and scenes strip.
