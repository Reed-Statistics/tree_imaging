## Research Log


Spring, Week 4
----------------
  
### This Week's Work
Compared masked raster images in QGIS and discovered that the masks remove river pixels but not lake pixels if the lake is a greenish color. In general, if a field of grass is a brown color, it gets removed, but some greener fields are not masked out. The mask does a good job of keeping the forest pixels while still removing building structures and roads.

Used `caret` package to train random forest and support vector machine models. However, the random forests had a 100% prediction accuracy, and I couldn't figure out why. Performed k-fold (k = 5, 10) cross validation on svm and random forest models.

Some thesis sections:
  + added images showing the process of drawing polygons
  + added ndvi and grass mask section
  + methods: train models using caret package test them with cross validation


### Upcoming Work

Finish code to predict pixel tree species. Run models over raster images and map results. Add to methods chapter and results chapter.

### Points of confusion

Not sure why the random forests model from `caret` package had a 100% accuracy.
