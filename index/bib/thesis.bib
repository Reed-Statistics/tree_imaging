	abstract = {Societal Impact Statement Trees play a critical role for people and the planet. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the presence of trees and urban nature can improve people's mental and physical health, children's attention and test scores, the property values in a neighborhood, and beyond. Trees cool our urban centers. Trees are essential for healthy communities and people. The benefits that trees provide can help cities and countries meet 15 of the 17 internationally supported United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This critical review provides a comprehensive argument that trees should be considered an important part of the equation by project managers and civic leaders as we collectively work toward reaching these sustainability goals. Summary We live in an era influenced by humans to the point that the Earth's systems are now altered. In addition, a majority of the world's population live in cities. To meet the needs of people in a changing world, The United Nations General Assembly created the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) to improve the quality of life for people. These broad goals outline the greatest challenges of our time. An effective strategy to assist in meeting these goals is to plant and protect trees, especially in cities where the majority of people live. This paper serves as a critical review of the benefits of trees. Trees promote health and social well-being by removing air pollution, reducing stress, encouraging physical activity, and promoting social ties and community. Children with views of trees are more likely to succeed in school. Trees promote a strong economy and can provide numerous resources to the people that need them. While cities are getting hotter, trees can reduce urban temperatures. They provide habitat and food for animals. Finally, trees are valuable green infrastructure to manage stormwater. Money spent on urban forestry has a high return on investment. As we navigate this human-dominated era, we need skilled people who understand the nuances of the built environment and trees as we strategically plan the cities of the future. The overwhelming evidence from the scientific literature suggests that investing in trees is an investment in meeting the UN SDG, and ultimately an investment for a better world.},

Two recently proposed architectures, CaffeNet and GoogLeNet, are adopted, with three different learning modalities.

	abstract = {In this study, we automate tree species classiﬁcation and mapping using ﬁeld-based training data, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a convolutional neural network classiﬁer (CNN). We tested our methods by identifying seven dominant trees species as well as dead standing trees in a mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA (USA) using training, validation, and testing datasets composed of spatially-explicit transects and plots sampled across a single strip of imaging spectroscopy. We also used a three-band ‘Red-Green-Blue’ pseudo true-color subset of the hyperspectral imagery strip to test the classiﬁcation accuracy of a CNN model without the additional non-visible spectral data provided in the hyperspectral imagery. Our classiﬁer is pixel-based rather than object based, although we use three-dimensional structural information from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to identify trees (points {\textgreater} 5 m above the ground) and the classiﬁer was applied to image pixels that were thus identiﬁed as tree crowns. By training a CNN classiﬁer using ﬁeld data and hyperspectral imagery, we were able to accurately identify tree species and predict their distribution, as well as the distribution of tree mortality, across the landscape. Using a window size of 15 pixels and eight hidden convolutional layers, a CNN model classiﬁed the correct species of 713 individual trees from hyperspectral imagery with an average F-score of 0.87 and F-scores ranging from 0.67–0.95 depending on species. The CNN classiﬁcation model performance increased from a combined F-score of 0.64 for the Red-Green-Blue model to a combined F-score of 0.87 for the hyperspectral model. The hyperspectral CNN model captures the species composition changes across {\textasciitilde}700 meters (1935 to 2630 m) of elevation from a lower-elevation mixed oak conifer forest to a higher-elevation ﬁr-dominated coniferous forest. High resolution tree species maps can support forest ecosystem monitoring and management, and identifying dead trees aids landscape assessment of forest mortality resulting from drought, insects and pathogens. We publicly provide our code to apply deep learning classiﬁers to tree species identiﬁcation from geospatial imagery and ﬁeld training data.},

	abstract = {Urban trees and grass have different ecological functions and services. Remote sensing provides a feasible way of quantifying urban vegetative cover and distribution at large scale. Most previous studies have used supervised classification based on high resolution images to map urban trees and grass. However, due to the lack of specialized features for distinguishing coarse and fine vegetation, the classification accuracy of urban trees and grass is consistently low. Although adding 3D topographical information can improve accuracy, such data has limited availability. This paper developed a tree-grass differentiation index (TGDI) to facilitate the fast and effective classification of urban trees and grass. We examined the performance of the new index by applying it to different classification methods. We compared the classification of Method 1: supervised classification without TGDI; Method 2: supervised classification with TGDI; and Method 3: rule-based classification with TGDI. The results showed that the overall accuracy of Method 1, Method 2, and Method 3 were, 84 \%, 88 \%, and 90.5 \%, respectively. Using the new index can improve the classification of urban trees and grass regardless if TGDI is used alone for rule-based classification or added as a feature for supervised classification. The main advantage of using TGDI is to reduce the misclassification of sunlit portions of trees into grass. The producer accuracy of tree and the user accuracy of grass can be improved by more than 10 \% when TGDI is applied to supervised classification. This study synthesized texture and spectral features, which enhances the traditional approach of index construction based on spectral features alone, and without the requirement of detailed 3D surface data. The results suggest a novel way forward for developing indexes that can yield improved accuracies and expand the utility of remote sensing for illuminating patterns of ecological structure and function in urban environments.},
