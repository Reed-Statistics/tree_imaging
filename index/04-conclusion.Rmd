## Training Results

Predicting on the grouped data produced the highest accuracies. The best model on the grouped data was the random forest training model with an mtry value of 1 predictor at each split and the following predictors: red, green, blue, infrared, NDVI, $\frac{\mbox{red}}{\mbox{green}}$, $\frac{\mbox{red}}{\mbox{blue}}$, $\frac{\mbox{blue}}{\mbox{green}}$. This model had a training predictive accuracy of 0.65 overall and 0.42 for Western redcedars specifically. On the test dataset, this model still accurately predicted 64% of the pixels, while the accuracy for predicting more than half the pixels correctly in the same polygon was 52%. 

The model that performed best at predicting all 7 tree classes was the radial SVM model with cost equal to 16 and $\sigma = 0.25$. The radial support vector machine had a training accuracy of 0.56 overall, 0.37 for just Western redcedars, and testing accuracy of 0.55 overall and 0.33 for Western redcedar pixels. For polygon predictions, the radial support vector machine had an accuracy of 32%. Between the 8 predictor RF model on the 5 classes data and the radial SVM model on the 7 classes data, the RF model outperforms the SVM model. This model is used to proceed with the final model over Portland.

## Modelling Tree Species in Portland

After masking the raster images of the entire region of Portland, the pre-trained models are used to predict the tree species of individual pixels in the masked raster images. The `predict.raster` function from RStudio's `raster` package takes a model and applying that model to each cell of the raster, leaving a raster with tree classification predictions. This function is used to predict tree species over all five raster strips, and the raster strips are merged to display predictions for the entire city. Figure \@ref(fig:rfPortland) displays the tree classification predictions given by the optimal random forest model over Portland and figure \@ref(fig:svmPortland) displays the predictions from the support vector machine model.

```

To assess the performance of the model over the Portland region, the results are compared to the remaining Western redcedars from `pdxTrees` both street and park data. The shapefiles for `pdxTrees` Western redcedars ground data are mapped over the classified pixel predictions, and the number of correctly and incorrectly classified pixels is recorded. Figure \@ref(fig:resultsToStreet) visualizes this comparison.
