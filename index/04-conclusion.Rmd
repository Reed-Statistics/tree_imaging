## Modelling Tree Species in Portland

After masking the raster images of the entire region of Portland, the pre-trained models are used to predict the tree species of individual pixels in the masked raster images. First the pixels are extracted from the raster and compiled into a dataset. Then the models are applied to predict the tree species per pixel in the dataset.

<!-- And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there. -->
